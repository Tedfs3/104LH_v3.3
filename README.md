# 104LH_v3.3
# This is a left handed version of user null's keyboard design on the forum GeekHack. https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=97883.0
# I have no idea what I'm doing and am just copying his design as best as possible while moving the numpad to the left side.
FreeRoute has been used to trace 99% of this PCB. Getting pointers on cleaning things up and just fixing odd routes has been a great help in learning how do things myself. Not close to trying to start something like this without the help of an auto router yet, maybe someday.
# v3.3.3 Prototype boards have been ordered. If they work properly, v3.3.3.1 will add support for Cherry MX Stabilizers.
